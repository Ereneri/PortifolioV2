    "fullDescription": "Built a fully working Flappy Bird clone in Java and a NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies implementation from scratch with a homegrown neural network that learns to play the game. As a fun quick project, the base game was built in ONLY 2 days during my Spring semester finals week. The neural network was built using a genetic algorithm, called NEAT, which stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. I built the NEAT implementation from scratch following the original white paper and various online resources. To check it out, check my GitHub link above. There are two versions of the game, one where the player controls the bird and the other where the NEAT implementation controls the bird. Below you can see a quick demo of the early tests of the NEAT algorithm in action.",

The algorithms used were minimax, Expectiminimax, and Monte Carlo Tree Search. The project is a fork of an existing 2048 AI solver, with some modifications to the code to allow for the implementation of the three algorithms. Then a C script was used to run the experiment in parallel to compare the algorithms. The results of the experiment were then analyzed and discussed in the paper. All the data analysis was done in R.

When a task is created it tells others who created the task below the task title. When a user completes that task it strikes out everything and tells others who completed it. Once a task is completed it can be deleted from the list by clicking the 'X' on the right of the task. However, if a task is not completed, it can be edited by clicking on the 'pen' icon on the right. Additionally, users can 'pin' a task by clicking the star next to the list on either the 'Home' page or the 'All Lists' page. If a user already has a 'pinned' task then the 'Home' page with automatically open that list. A user can 'unpin' a list but simply clicking on the yellow star on the 'All Lists' page. I plan on added more features and releasing this build to get real world use. ",

The game is played in a 2D environment where the player, a spaceship, can move left, right, up, and down. The player can also shoot rockets that will destroy asteroids. The objective of the game is to increase your score by collecting metals: silver, iron, and gold. The player can also collect a wrench which will increase the player's health, which decreases if they collide with an asteroid. However, the player can also increase their health by using their score to purchase a 'mechanics repair' in the shop, or press 'H' as a shortcut. If the player can increase their health up to 200%, with 100% as the base health and an additionally 100% as a shield.",
