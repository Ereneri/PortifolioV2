    "fullDescription": "Developed three Apache Kafka Streams applications for a fictional music streaming platform, 'Utopia', as part of a Master's course on Event-Driven Architecture. These applications process real-time event streams to deliver business insights using advanced streaming concepts like stateful aggregations, multi-stream joins, and windowed operations. The project answers three key business questions: identifying trending artists by demographic and location, tracking the most profitable venues based on ticket sales, and clustering customers who share the same favorite artist for targeted campaigns.",

    "fullDescription": "Built a fully functional 1-1 Flappy Bird clone in Java. Then implemented a NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) implementation on top of the clone with a homegrown neural network. The AI uses serveral data inputs to that learns to play the game. As a fun quick project, the base game was built in under 2 days as a development challenge. The neural network was built using a genetic algorithm, called NEAT, which I built from scratch following the original white paper and various online resources. To check it out for yourself, check out my GitHub link above. There are two branches in the Github repository, one where the player controls the bird and the other where the NEAT implementation controls the bird. Below you can see a quick demo of the early tests of the NEAT algorithm in action.",

The project is a fork of an existing 2048 AI solver, with some modifications to the code to allow for the implementation of the three algorithms. Then a C script was used to run the experiment in parallel to compare the algorithms. The results of the experiment were then analyzed and discussed in the paper. All the data analysis was done in R. The full paper and analysis can be found in the media section below.",

You can ask it anything from planet composition to the history of its discovery. Explore and learn about our solar system in a fun and engaging way, choosing from one of five education levels to get varying levels of output complexity. All artwork was handcrafted, including animated talking GIFs for each planet (see below). Our web application was built using Django as a simple backend with a React frontend. The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for large language model capabilities. TailwindCSS was used for styling. Check out the GitHub link to see the code and try it out for yourself!

Once added, users can add new tasks or mark tasks as complete. When a task is created, it displays who created it. When a user completes that task, it strikes out the text and displays who completed it. This system provides visibility into who has completed what and who requested tasks. Once a task is completed, it can be deleted by simply clicking the 'X' on the right-hand side of the task list. If a task is not completed yet, it can be edited by clicking on the 'pen' icon. Additionally, users can 'pin' a list by clicking the star next to it on either the 'Home' page or the 'All Lists' page. If a user has a 'pinned' list, the 'Home' page will automatically open that list. A user can 'unpin' a list by simply clicking on the yellow star on the 'All Lists' page. I plan on adding more features and releasing this build for real-world use.",

Players can shoot rockets to explode asteroids; however, collision causes damage. There are two main health bars: a shield, visible as a blue sphere, and the ship's hull. Once the shield is destroyed, the blue sphere disappears. To repair the spaceship, players can collect rare metals: silver, iron, and gold. These metals increase the user's score, which can be used in the in-game shop. Players can also collect powerups, such as a wrench, to increase health for free. Within the shop, players can purchase health boosts using their score ('mechanic's repair') or press 'H' as a shortcut. The game features a leaderboard, allowing users to enter 3-letter initials to store the top 5 high scores locally. Check out the GitHub link to see the code and try it out for yourself!",
